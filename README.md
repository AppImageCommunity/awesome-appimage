# Awesome AppImage [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

[AppImage](https://appimage.org) is a community-based format to distribute applications to various mainstream Linux distributions without the need for a centralized store. One app = one file! This list contains tools to work with AppImages, such as to create AppImages for applications and to integrate AppImages into the system easily. As the vibrant community around AppImage is growing, so is this list.
